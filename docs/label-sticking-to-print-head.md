# Label sticks to print head

## Observation

* Label prints partway and then gets 'stuck'
* Label gets stuck, won't feed during print, feeds fine manually
* Label makes a "pop" noise when pulling free

## Cause

Print density (darkness) is too high for the label type, and the label is getting stuck to the print head during printing.

Thermal label printers heat the print head to a high temperature, if it's too high for the material it will cause the material to become tacky and stick to the print head.

## Fix

Make the print head heat the material less by either increasing the speed of the print or decreasing the density (darkness) of the print.
